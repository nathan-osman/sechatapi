## sechatapi

The Stack Exchange chat network does not currently provide a user-friendly API. Go applications can use the [go-sechat](https://github.com/nathan-osman/go-sechat) package to interact with the chat server, but how can an Android app written in Java utilize this package?

Enter sechatapi.

This application acts as a bridge between Java and the go-sechat package. It is a standalone application written in Go that provides an HTTP API that Java applications can use. Go applications can be compiled for ARM CPUs, allowing the application to run directly on end-user devices.
